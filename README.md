# TorchMoji API
Lets you make simple API calls to TorchMoji models.

## Installation

After you've made sure https://github.com/huggingface/torchMoji is working fine, copy the `torchmoji` and `model` directories over into the root of this one. I frankly had a hard time getting that repo to work right, and don't remember what all it needed to get it running and since I'm in prototyping mode, you get to figure it out too if you wanna use this. 

If someone else wants to write a guide, I'll happily accept the pull request.
